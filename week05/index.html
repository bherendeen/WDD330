                <h2>Notes</h2>

                <h3>Errors</h3>
                <p>Errors are usually caused by the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>System error:</strong> there's a problem with the system or external devices
                        the program interacts with
                        that can
                        cause a system error.</li>
                    <li><strong>Programmer error:</strong> the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it
                        could be as simple as a typo.</li>
                    <li><strong>User error:</strong> the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program cannot
                        handle.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Exceptions</h3>

                <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal
                    with the error.</p>

                <p>Exceptions use stack trace, a sequence of functions or method calls leading to the error's point.
                    It'll work backward to find the original.</p>

                <p>Warnings can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.
                </p>

                <h3>Strict Mode</h3>

                <p>Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated
                    features.</p>

                <p>To use strict mode, enter the string <code>'use strict';</code> on the first line of the JS file or a
                    per-function basis.</p>

                <h3>Linting</h3>

                <p>JS Linting like JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code
                    beyond simply using strict mode.</p>

                <p>Linting tools are also helpful in enforcing a programming style guide. This is particularly useful
                    when working in a team, as it ensures everybody follows the same conventions.</p>

                <h3>Debugging in Browser</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/breakpoints/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Chrome</a> </li>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FireFox</a> </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Using the <code>debugger;</code> keyword will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the
                    execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently doing. You can also hover
                    over any variables to see what value they hold at that point. The program can then be restarted by
                    clicking on the 'play' button.</p>

                <p><span>ðŸ‘†</span> Remember to remove or comment out the <code>//debugger;</code> code before code
                    production.
                </p>

                <h3>Error Objects</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><code>EvalError</code> is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for
                        backward compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global <code>eval()</code>
                        function.</li>
                    <li><code>RangeError</code> is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
                    <li><code>ReferenceError</code> is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn't exist.
                        For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.</li>
                    <li><code>SyntaxError</code> is thrown when there's an error in the code's syntax.</li>
                    <li><code>TypeError</code> is thrown when there's an error in the type of value used; for example, a
                        string is used when a number is expected.</li>
                    <li><code>URIError</code> is thrown when there's a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>
                    <li><code>InternalError</code> is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the
                        JavaScript engineâ€”a common cause of this too much recursion.</li>
                </ul>
